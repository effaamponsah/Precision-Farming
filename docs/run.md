> Due to threading issues, the piece of code that runs the devices needs to be started. Feel free to send a pull request when you find a fix.

Now that you have been able to run the web application, it will continuesly listen for changes from the sensors. That means we need to start the device software.

To start the device, naviate into `combinedCode` directory and type `python3 combined.py`.

## THATS IS !!
