Data is made accessible to the world via the port. An extensive explanation on web ports can be found [here](www.google.com). To make this dream a reality, we used [ngrok](www.ngrok.com).


## Why ngrok

Ngrok is used to expose our port to the outside world. This was considered due to security issues because we didnt host the application in the cloud due to security issues
