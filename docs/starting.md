Welcome to the developer documentation website for Precision Farming. It is built with [Docusaurus](www.docusaurus.com). Feel free to contribute to this project and we will be happy to receive your changes.

## Introduction

This project is a final year student project which uses raspberry pi together with some sensors to help monitor soil and the plant conditions over time and gives the user access to this data via a dashboard.
This documentation discusses:

- Hardware used and their assembly.
- How to get the software up running from the raspberry pi(even on a fresh pi).
- How to setup the automated call which notifies users.
- Some useful links to the project.

### Project Composition

The main project may be sub divided into these main sections.

1. [Software](doc3)
    - The web app
    - The software controlling the sensors
    - Putting data on the WWW

2. The [hardware](sensors) and assembly
    - Devices used
    - Assembly of the parts
3. The documentation website

> Please ensure that you have access to the raspberry pi and all the [sensors](doc5) that we used in this project.
